# Dolphin Anty Automation with Selenium

This repo is created to automate proxy browsers of Dolphin Anty with Selenium.



# open_profile.py

This file is how can you open a browser to use with Selenium.


# delete_profile.py

This file is how can you list and delete all the profiles(browsers) on Dolphin Anty.


# create_profile.py

This file is how you can create and update profiles via api. 


# Note
You need to have chromedriver to open profiles and use with selenium. It can be downloaded on dolphin anty's documentation.  
Chrome driver download link is: anty-browser.s3.amazonaws.com/chromedriver-124.zip
I've only shared basic CRUD operations for profiles. There is an official documentation for wider usage.
Hope that was helpfull.
